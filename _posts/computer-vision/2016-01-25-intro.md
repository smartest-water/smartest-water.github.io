Computer vision is a field that includes methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding images and, in general, high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions.

- Sampling: digitizing the coordinate values 
- Quantization: digitizing the amplitude values

- Image resolution: the largest number of discernible line pairs per unit distance 
- Intensity resolution: the smallest discernible change in intensity level, usually refer to the number of bits used to quantize intensity
