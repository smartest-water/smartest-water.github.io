#### ABSTRACT

There are lots of same technology ideas between single computer architecture and cloud Computing system(Distributed system). We will discuss these ideas in these area:

- Abstractions of the computer system and the abstractions of the distribution system.
- How Queue implemented both the threads control in the single computer and balance control in the cloud computing.
- The ideas of the File system between the Linux system and distribution system(HDFS, GFS).
- Data communication between GPU, memory and project, database.
- notify idea in thread control and zookeeper in Hadoop system.
- pipeline in CPU and big data, example: photo OCR

No matter build a single computer or cloud system, basically people use the same idea.  

#### Same knowledge

- Abstraction
    + How people use abstraction to define different lays of the system.
    + Abstraction is always the most important idea in building the system, not only computer architecture, but all the things, by the way I believe the humans' history is the abstractions history, we abstract the nature and the world.  
- Queue implemented in the threads control and balance control in the cloud.
    + how queue be implemented in the thread control of the CPU
    + How important the queue in cloud computing, include MapReduce control and balance the use request and so on.
    + Example: Fafka in Linkedin
- File system of the Linux system and distribution system(HDFS, GFS).
    + Hadoop system use the same idea of the Linux system.
    + use all most same command to deal with the File system.
    + Hadoop fs -ls /home/
    + ls /home/
- Data communication between GPU, memory and project, database.
    + gaga
    + CRUD
- notify idea in thread control and zookeeper in Hadoop system.
- pipeline in CPU and big data, example: photo OCR
    + shopping cart steps
    + order steps
    + photo OCR

#### Future

- GPU plus Map Reduce
- Low level of mongoDB let operating system control the thread for it.
- HDFS is based on Linux file system.

In our area, every part they always have same idea, if we can master one of the idea, I believe we can make our selves better.

From operation system, hardware of computer to the cloud, there are some many commons ideas between. And these ideas are the basic knowledge of computer science.

#### Conclusion

The ideas between computer architecture and cloud Computing or distributed system. More I think all the ideas between technology are same. If we like or interest something, just word hard for it.

Computer science is an great major, it's not only need thinking things logically but also need us do it manually which is by our hand.

The creative is not only invent the totally new things, but standing on the shoulders of giants and step forward. Wish after we leaned the basic ideas, we could create our own cool things, to make the world a little different.
