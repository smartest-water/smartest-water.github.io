#### ABSTRACT

There are lots of same technology ideas between single computer architecture and cloud Computing system. We will discuss these ideas in these area:

- Abstractions of the computer system and the abstractions of the distribution system.
- Queue implemented in the threads control and balance control in the cloud.
- File system of the Linux system and distribution system(HDFS, GFS).
- Data communication between GPU, memory and project, database.
- notify idea in thread control and zookeeper in Hadoop system.
- pipeline in CPU and big data, example: photo OCR

#### Same knowledge

- Abstraction
    + Abstraction is always the most important idea in building the system, not only computer architecture, but all the things, by the way I believe the humans' history is the abstractions history, we abstract the nature and the world.  
- Abstractions of the computer system and the abstractions of the distribution system.
- Queue implemented in the threads control and balance control in the cloud.
- File system of the Linux system and distribution system(HDFS, GFS).
- Data communication between GPU, memory and project, database.
- notify idea in thread control and zookeeper in Hadoop system.
- pipeline in CPU and big data, example: photo OCR

thread control in operation system and Queue in balance and control

#### Future

- GPU plus Map Reduce
- Low level of mongoDB let operating system control the thread for it.
- HDFS is based on Linux file system.

In our area, every part they always have same idea, if we can master one of the idea, I believe we can make our selves better.

From operation system, hardware of computer to the cloud, there are some many commons ideas between. And these ideas are the basic knowledge of computer science.

#### Conclusion

The ideas between computer architecture and cloud Computing or distributed system. More I think all the ideas between technology are same. If we like or interest something, just word hard for it.
