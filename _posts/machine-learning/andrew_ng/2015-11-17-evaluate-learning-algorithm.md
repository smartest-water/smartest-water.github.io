Cross Validation

1. randomly shuffle or reorder the data
2. partial data into training set and test set
3. learn parameter from training data
4. computer test set error

Model Selection (choose polynomial degree)

1. use different polynomial degree to train data
2. use test set to find which degree is most fit the data

Split data into three pieces (Train/Validation/Test Sets)

1. Training Set (60%)
2. Cross Validation Set (20%)
3. Test Set (20%)
